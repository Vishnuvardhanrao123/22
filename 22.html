I do not dine in a restaurant very frequently. 
In fact, I prefer to eat homemade foods. 
However, there are some occasions when
 I prefer meeting people at a restaurant 
and like to taste the delicious menus the restaurants offer.
 One such restaurant is ‘Plaza de Capita Foods’ that
 I really like and I would like to thank you for the opportunity to talk
 about a great restaurant where I enjoyed going to.
